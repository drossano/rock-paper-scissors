This was a lot of fun! Back in college I used (read: struggled to use) some MATLAB and JavaScript so this kind of programming wasn't completely foreign to me. Planning the project out using pseudo code was very helpful in getting the basic structure down. Initially I was able to get some games working using global variables but I realized that I should be using parameters for my functions and fixed that. I also did looked up some concepts that haven't been covered yet (for and while loops) and implemented them into the project!
